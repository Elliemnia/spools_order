# spools_order
1.	The Middletown Wire Company sells spools of copper wiring for $100 each. The normal delivery charge is $10 per spool.  Rush delivery costs $15 per spool. 
2.	The application that displays the status of an order.  The status should include the following:
o	The number of spools ready to ship.
o	The number of spools on back order.
o	The shipping and handling charges.
o	The total amount due.
The applicationâ€™s form should resemble the one below:
 
The user should enter the number of spools ordered into the text box, and check the Rush Delivery check box if rush delivery is desired.  When the Calculate Total button is clicked, an input box should appear asking the user to enter the number of spools currently in stock.  If the user has ordered more spools than are in stock, a portion of the order is back-ordered.  For example, if the user orders 200 spools and there are only 150 spools in stock, then 150 spools are ready to ship and 50 spools are back-ordered.
